Some example components styled like [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) using [Templ](https://templ.guide).
This is meant as a starting point for UI in a project and NOT as an installable package.

Things will be added, changed or deleted at will.

### Usage

Copy the component templ files and css into your own project and see the examples for usage.

### Development

install air for reloading:
```bash
go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
```

then just run:
```bash
air
```
