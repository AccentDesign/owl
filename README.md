Some example components styled like [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) using [Templ](https://templ.guide).
This is meant as a starting point for UI in a project and NOT as an installable package.

Things will be added, changed or deleted at will.

### Usage

Copy stuff and see the examples for usage.

### Development

go install github.com/a-h/templ/cmd/templ@latest
```

then just run:

```
